        <h1>Welcome to my First Website!</h1>
        <p>I'm just testing out HTML right now. I actually know some HTML from when I was a kid, I used to learn... In order to customize my Neopets shop (or whatever page it was). It stayed with me. Now I'm doing a refresher. In order to celebrate my new found passion for coding, I thought I'd share this great gif representing unity, and a dope song.</p>

        <h2>How I'm Learning</h2>
        <p>I've spent some time researching the best way to take notes. I ended up finding a tool called Quiver that I'm currently trialing, but it seems to be really great for documentation.</p>
        <p>I spent some time playing around with it to decide how to actually setup my documentation. I begrudgingly ended up reading the tutorial, which was actually quick and very helpful. I then landed on the following approach, using a tool called Quiver.</p>
        <strong>Method:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use markdown to explain what I'm doing</li>
            <li>Insert an example of the code in actions</li>
            <li>Show the code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method allows me to take detailed notes that are easily readanble using Quiver's preview functionality. When I review the notes in the future, I can quickly use the preview view to find my codes and see what they do.</p>
        <strong>Benefits of this Method:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>I have detailed documentation to reference</li>
            <li>My documentation can be shared with others.</li>
            <li>I learn better by recording everything I do.</li> 
        </ol>
