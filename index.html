        <h1>Welcome to my First Website!</h1>
        <p>To get started, try clicking this button below where you can change your name. The only real difference will be, that we all know, no matter what our name, that Kish is shit at Catan. Among other things, but that's for another website.</p>
        <button class="button-block">Click me!!! See what happens above!</button><br><br>
        <div id="column2"><img id="kishpic" src="images/kish.jpg"></div>
        <div id="column1"><p>This guy next to me, is really shitty. Like, has to beg his friend Steve for a bailout worse than Melvin Capital asking for Robinhood to bail them out shitty. That's wild, right?</p></div>

        <p>I'm just testing out HTML right now. I actually know some HTML from when I was a kid, I used to learn... In order to customize my Neopets shop (or whatever page it was). It stayed with me. Now I'm doing a refresher. In order to celebrate my new found passion for coding, I thought I'd share this great gif representing unity, and a dope song.</p>

        <h2>How I'm Learning</h2>
        <p>I've spent some time researching the best way to take notes. I ended up finding a tool called Quiver that I'm currently trialing, but it seems to be really great for documentation.</p>
        <p>I spent some time playing around with it to decide how to actually setup my documentation. I begrudgingly ended up reading the tutorial, which was actually quick and very helpful. I then landed on the following approach, using a tool called Quiver.</p>
        <strong>Method:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use markdown to explain what I'm doing</li>
            <li>Insert an example of the code in actions</li>
            <li>Show the code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method allows me to take detailed notes that are easily readanble using Quiver's preview functionality. When I review the notes in the future, I can quickly use the preview view to find my codes and see what they do.</p>
        <strong>Benefits of this Method:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>I have detailed documentation to reference</li>
            <li>My documentation can be shared with others.</li>
            <li>I learn better by recording everything I do.</li> 
        </ol>
